# DoorDash - First Ever Ratings

# Link - https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2114-first-ever-ratings?code_type=2 

The company you work for is looking at their delivery drivers' first-ever delivery with the company.

You have been tasked with finding what percentage of drivers' first-ever completed orders have a rating of 0.

Note: Please remember that if an order has a blank value for actual_delivery_time, 
it has been canceled and therefore does not count as a completed delivery.

df = delivery_orders.copy()

# Filter out canceled orders
df = df[df['actual_delivery_time'].notna()]

# Sort by driver_id and order_placed_time to find the first completed order for each driver
df = df.sort_values(by=['driver_id', 'order_placed_time'])

# Drop duplicates to get the first order for each driver
first_orders = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['driver_id'], keep='first')

# Calculate the percentage of first orders with a rating of 0
total_first_orders = len(first_orders)
first_orders_with_zero_rating = len(first_orders[first_orders['delivery_rating'] == 0])

percentage = (first_orders_with_zero_rating / total_first_orders) * 100

print(f"Percentage of drivers' first-ever completed orders with a rating of 0: {percentage:.2f}%")
