Christmas is quickly approaching, and your team anticipates an increase in sales. 
 To predict the busiest restaurants, they wanted to identify the top two restaurants by ID in terms of sales in 2022.

The output should include the restaurant IDs and their corresponding sales.

Note: Please remember that if an order has a blank value for actual_delivery_time, 
 it has been canceled and therefore does not count towards monthly sales.

# Convert date columns to datetime
delivery_orders['order_placed_time'] = pd.to_datetime(delivery_orders['order_placed_time'], format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M')
delivery_orders['actual_delivery_time'] = pd.to_datetime(delivery_orders['actual_delivery_time'], format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M')

# Filter out canceled orders
delivery_orders = delivery_orders[delivery_orders['actual_delivery_time'].notna()]

# Filter orders placed in 2022
delivery_orders_2022 = delivery_orders[delivery_orders['order_placed_time'].dt.year == 2022]

# Merge DataFrames on delivery_id
merged_df = pd.merge(order_value, delivery_orders_2022, on='delivery_id')

# Aggregate sales by restaurant_id
restaurant_sales = merged_df.groupby('restaurant_id')['sales_amount'].sum().reset_index()

# Identify top two restaurants by sales
top_two_restaurants = restaurant_sales.nlargest(2, 'sales_amount',keep = 'all')

# Display the result
print(top_two_restaurants)
