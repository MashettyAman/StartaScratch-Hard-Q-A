# DoorDash - Avg Earnings per Weekday and Hour

# https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2034-avg-earnings-per-weekday-and-hour?code_type=2

* You have been asked to calculate the average earnings per order segmented by a 
  combination of weekday (all 7 days) and hour using the column customer_placed_order_datetime.

* You have also been told that the column order_total represents the gross order total for each order. 
Therefore, you'll need to calculate the net order total.

* The gross order total is the total of the order before adding the tip and deducting the discount and refund.

* Note: In your output, the day of the week should be represented in text format (i.e., Monday). Also, round earnings to 2 decimals

# Start writing code
df = doordash_delivery.copy()

#Extract the days and hour
df['weekday'] = df['customer_placed_order_datetime'].dt.day_name()
df['hour'] = df['customer_placed_order_datetime'].dt.hour

# Calculate net order total
df['net_order_total'] = df['order_total'] - df['discount_amount'] + df['tip_amount']

# Group by weekday and hour, calculate average net order total
result = df.groupby(['weekday', 'hour'])['net_order_total'].mean().reset_index()

# Round earnings to 2 decimals
result['net_order_total'] = result['net_order_total'].round(2)

print(result)
