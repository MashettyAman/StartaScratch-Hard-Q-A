# Repeated Payments [CRED Interview Question]

# Solved both Python and SQL

# link - https://datalemur.com/questions/repeated-payments

* Sometimes, payment transactions are repeated by accident; it could be due to uer error, 
  API failure or a retry error that causes a credit card to be charged twice.

* Using the transactions table, identify any payments made at the same merchant with the same credit card 
for the same amount within 10 minutes of each other. Count such repeated payments.

* Assumptions:

* The first transaction of such payments should not be counted as a repeated payment. This means, 
if there are two transactions performed by a merchant with the same credit card and for the same amount within 10 minutes, 
there will only be 1 repeated payment.

# Convert transaction_timestamp to datetime
df['transaction_timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['transaction_timestamp'])

# Sort DataFrame by merchant_id, credit_card_id, amount, and transaction_timestamp
df = df.sort_values(by=['merchant_id', 'credit_card_id', 'amount', 'transaction_timestamp'])

# Calculate time difference between consecutive transactions
df['time_diff'] = df.groupby(['merchant_id', 'credit_card_id', 'amount'])['transaction_timestamp'].diff()

# # Identify repeated transactions within 10 minutes
df['is_repeated'] = (df['time_diff'] <= pd.Timedelta(minutes=10))

# # We do not count the first transaction as repeated, so we use shift to adjust
df['is_repeated'] = df.groupby(['merchant_id', 'credit_card_id', 'amount'])['is_repeated'].shift(-1, fill_value=False)

# # Count repeated transactions
repeated_payments_count = df['is_repeated'].sum()

print(f"Number of repeated payments: {repeated_payments_count}")



## SQL

WITH payments AS (
  SELECT 
    merchant_id, 
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM transaction_timestamp - 
      LAG(transaction_timestamp) OVER(
        PARTITION BY merchant_id, credit_card_id, amount 
        ORDER BY transaction_timestamp)
    )/60 AS minute_difference 
  FROM transactions) 

SELECT COUNT(merchant_id) AS payment_count
FROM payments 
WHERE minute_difference <= 10;

/***********************************************************************
EPOCH calculates the total number of seconds in a given interval.
To calculate the difference in minutes, we divide these seconds by 60
(1 minute = 60 seconds). For example, the time interval 
for transaction id 5 is 1 hour and 9 minutes. 
EPOCH calculates its value as 4140 seconds. 
By dividing it by 60, we arrive at 69 minutes
