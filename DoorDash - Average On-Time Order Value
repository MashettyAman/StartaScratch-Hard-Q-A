#DoorDash - Average On-Time Order Value

#Link - https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2153-average-on-time-order-value?code_type=2

The ideal time between when a customer places an order and when the order is delivered is below or equal to 45 minutes.

You have been tasked with evaluating delivery driver performance by calculating the average order value 

for each delivery driver who has delivered at least once within this 45-minute period.

Your output should contain the driver ID along with their corresponding average order value.

# df = delivery_details.copy()

# Convert the relevant columns to datetime
df['customer_placed_order_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['customer_placed_order_datetime'])
df['delivered_to_consumer_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['delivered_to_consumer_datetime'])

# Calculate the difference in minutes between customer_placed_order_datetime and delivered_to_consumer_datetime
df['delivery_time_minutes'] = (df['delivered_to_consumer_datetime'] - df['customer_placed_order_datetime']).dt.total_seconds() / 60

# Filter rows where the delivery time is less than or equal to 45 minutes
filtered_df = df[df['delivery_time_minutes'] <= 45]

# Calculate the average order value for each delivery driver
average_order_value = filtered_df.groupby('driver_id')['order_total'].mean().reset_index()

# Rename the columns for better understanding
average_order_value.columns = ['driver_id', 'average_order_value']

# Display the result
print(average_order_value)
