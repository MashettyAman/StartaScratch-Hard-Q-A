# Growth of Airbnb

// Estimate the growth of Airbnb each year using the number of hosts registered as the growth metric. 

The rate of growth is calculated by taking 
((number of hosts registered in the current year - number of hosts registered in the previous year) / 
                                                            the number of hosts registered in the previous year) * 100Output the year, 
number of hosts in the current year, number of hosts in the previous year, and the rate of growth. 
Round the rate of growth to the nearest percent and order the result in the ascending order based on the year.
Assume that the dataset consists only of unique hosts, meaning there are no duplicate hosts listed.//

import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
df = airbnb_search_details

# Convert 'host_since' to datetime
df['host_since'] = pd.to_datetime(df['host_since'])

# Extract year from 'host_since'
df['year'] = df['host_since'].dt.year

# Count number of hosts per year
hosts_per_year = df.groupby('year').size().reset_index(name='number_of_hosts')

# Calculate the rate of growth
hosts_per_year['previous_year_hosts'] = hosts_per_year['number_of_hosts'].shift(1)
hosts_per_year['growth_rate'] = ((hosts_per_year['number_of_hosts'] - hosts_per_year['previous_year_hosts']) / hosts_per_year['previous_year_hosts']) * 100

# Round the growth rate to the nearest percent
hosts_per_year['growth_rate'] = hosts_per_year['growth_rate'].round()

# Drop rows with NaN values (first year will not have previous year data)
hosts_per_year = hosts_per_year.dropna()

# Select relevant columns and sort by year
result = hosts_per_year[['year', 'number_of_hosts', 'previous_year_hosts', 'growth_rate']].sort_values(by='year')
