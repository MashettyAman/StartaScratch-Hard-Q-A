# Link - https://datalemur.com/questions/international-call-percentage

A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.
What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal.

# Explaination
There is a total of 4 calls with 2 of them being international calls (from caller_id 1 => receiver_id 5, and caller_id 5 => receiver_id 1). Thus, 2/4 = 50.0%

WITH international_calls AS (
SELECT 
  caller.caller_id, 
  caller.country_id,
  receiver.caller_id, 
  receiver.country_id
FROM phone_calls AS calls
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS caller
  ON calls.caller_id = caller.caller_id
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS receiver
  ON calls.receiver_id = receiver.caller_id
WHERE caller.country_id <> receiver.country_id
)

SELECT 
  ROUND(
    100.0 * COUNT(*)
  / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM phone_calls),1) AS international_call_pct
FROM international_calls;
