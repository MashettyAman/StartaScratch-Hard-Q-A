# Delta - The Cheapest Airline Connection

COMPANY X employees are trying to find the cheapest flights to upcoming conferences. When people fly long distances, a direct city-to-city flight is often more expensive than taking two flights with a stop in a hub city. Travelers might save even more money by breaking the trip into three flights with two stops. But for the purposes of this challenge, let's assume that no one is willing to stop three times! You have a table with individual airport-to-airport flights, which contains the following columns:


• id - the unique ID of the flight;
• origin - the origin city of the current flight;
• destination - the destination city of the current flight;
• cost - the cost of current flight.


Your task is to produce a trips table that lists all the cheapest possible trips that can be done in two or fewer stops. This table should have the columns origin, destination and total_cost (cheapest one). Sort the output table by origin, then by destination. The cities are all represented by an abbreviation composed of three uppercase English letters. Note: A flight from SFO to JFK is considered to be different than a flight from JFK to SFO.

Example of the output:
origin | destination | total_cost
DFW | JFK | 200

# Direct flights
direct_flights = flights_df[['origin', 'destination', 'cost']]

# Start writing code
flights_df  = da_flights.copy()

# Direct flights
direct_flights = flights_df[['origin', 'destination', 'cost']]

# One-stop flights
one_stop_flights = pd.merge(flights_df, flights_df, left_on='destination', right_on='origin')

#calculate the total cost
one_stop_flights['total_cost'] = one_stop_flights['cost_x'] + one_stop_flights['cost_y']

#select only required column
one_stop_flights = one_stop_flights[['origin_x', 'destination_y', 'total_cost']]
#rename the columns as per requirement
one_stop_flights.columns = ['origin', 'destination', 'cost']

#filter out the same orgin and destination if any 
one_stop_flights = one_stop_flights[one_stop_flights['origin'] != one_stop_flights['destination']]

# Combine direct and one-stop flights
all_flights = pd.concat([direct_flights, one_stop_flights])

# Get the cheapest flights for each origin-destination pair
cheapest_flights = all_flights.groupby(['origin', 'destination'], as_index=False).min()

# Sort the results
cheapest_flights = cheapest_flights.sort_values(by=['origin', 'destination'])

# Display the result
print(cheapest_flights)
