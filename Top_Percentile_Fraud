# Top Percentile Fraud

ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

### How to  achive  it

Load the data.
Calculate the 95th percentile fraud score for each state.
Filter the claims that are in the top 5 percentile for each state.
Extract the required columns: policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.


path = "Kaggale/fraud_score.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(path)

# Calculate the 95th percentile fraud score for each state
percentiles = df.groupby('state')['fraud_score'].quantile(0.95).reset_index()
percentiles.columns = ['state', '95th_percentile']

# Merge the percentiles back with the original DataFrame
df = df.merge(percentiles, on='state')

# Filter the claims that are in the top 5 percentile for each state
top_5_percentile_claims = df[df['fraud_score'] >= df['95th_percentile']]

# Select the required columns
output = top_5_percentile_claims[['policy_num', 'state', 'claim_cost', 'fraud_score']]
print(output)
