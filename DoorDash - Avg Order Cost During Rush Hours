# DoorDash - Avg Order Cost During Rush Hours

The company you work for has asked you to look into the average order value per hour during rush hours in the San Jose area.
Rush hour is from 15H - 17H inclusive.

You have also been told that the column order_total represents the gross order total for each order. 
Therefore, you'll need to calculate the net order total.

The gross order total is the total of the order before adding the tip and deducting the discount and refund.
Use the column customer_placed_order_datetime for your calculations.

# convert it into timestamp
df['customer_placed_order_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['customer_placed_order_datetime'])

#extract the hour from order_datetime
df['Hour'] = df['customer_placed_order_datetime'].dt.hour

#filter out the time 15H - 17H and region as San Jose
# df = delivery_details.query('( Hour.between(15, 17) and delivery_region == "San Jose") ')
filtered_df = df[(df['Hour'].between(15, 17)) & (df['delivery_region'] == "San Jose")]

#Aggregate the data based hour & order_total
result = filtered_df.groupby('Hour')['order_total'].mean().reset_index()
print(result)
